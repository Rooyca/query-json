Query JSON is a Obsidian plugin designed to simplify the process of querying and extracting data from JSON objects. By incorporating a user-friendly syntax, the plugin enables you to retrieve specific information from JSON data stored within your notes or external files.

## ‚ö° How to Use

To utilize QJSON, simply include the plugin's syntax within your note, encapsulating the JSON data or providing a file reference. Below is an example of the syntax:

~~~markdown
```qjson
#qj-id: 23
#qj-file: data.json
#qj-hide-id
#qj-show-json
```
~~~

> [!CAUTION]
> If your JSON files is considerably large it may slow down the rendering process. In those cases is better to [query the file directly.](#query-files-directly)

Then, you can query the data using the following syntax:

```
@23>store.books.0.author;
```

### Querying Data

Crafting queries with QJSON is straightforward, allowing you to refine and extract specific information tailored to your needs. For instance, consider the following JSON:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "books": [
      {
        "author": "John Doe",
        "title": "The Book"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To retrieve the author of the first book within the store, use the following query:

```
@23>store.books.0.author;
```

- `23`: represents the object identifier (ID)
- `store.books.0.author`: specifies the path to the desired data

#### Query files directly

Furthermore, QJSON extends its functionality to external JSON files. For example, if you possess a file named `data.json` containing the same JSON data as above, you can use the following query:

```
@data.json>store.books.0.author;
```

It's also posible to query the file directly using the `#qj-query` flag:

~~~markdown
```qjson
#qj-id: 24
#qj-file: data.json
#qj-show-json
#qj-hide-id
#qj-query: pageProps.heroData[win_rate >= 55 && role == Mage]
```
~~~

If you want to get all the elements of an array you can use the `*` wildcard:

~~~markdown
```qjson
#qj-id: 24
#qj-file: data.json
#qj-show-json
#qj-hide-id
#qj-query: pageProps.heroData[*]
```
~~~

## üè≥Ô∏è Flags

Query JSON supports various flags to enhance customization and functionality:

#### `#qj-id` INT (required)

This flag denotes the JSON object identifier. It must be unique and numeric.

#### `#qj-hide-id` (optional)

This flag suppresses the display of the identifier after rendering.

#### `#qj-desc` (optional)

Short for "id description," this flag provides a way to describe the JSON object. It is particularly useful for identifying the purpose of the object. The default value is `¬ª¬ª¬ª Query JSON ¬´¬´¬´`.

#### `#qj-show-json` (optional)

This flag allows you to display the JSON within the rendered output. By default is hidden.

#### `#qj-file` (optional)

If provided, this flag specifies the file path containing the JSON data. In its absence, the plugin scans for JSON data within the code block.

#### `#qj-query` (optional)

This flag allows you to query the JSON file directly from your codeblock. The query syntax must be inside brackets `[]`. The supported operators are:

- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

**Example**:

~~~markdown
```qjson
#qj-id: 24
#qj-file: data.json
#qj-show-json
#qj-hide-id
#qj-query: pageProps.heroData[win_rate >= 55 && role == Mage]
```
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `#qj-show-json` flag is mandatory when using the `#qj-query` flag.

### `#qj-format` (optional)

This flag allows you to format the output of the JSON data. The supported values are:

- `list`: displays the data in a list format
- `table`: displays the data in a table format
- `img`: displays the data as an image
